# Handlebar-gers

A simple app that utilizes Node, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars to allow users to dynamically update a database and have those changes reflected visually.

## The Basics

- Handlebar-gers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and stores them in a database.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
